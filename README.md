# moo.sh
moo.sh is a revolutionary shell script that aims to emulate the sound of a cow to very high degrees of precision.
## Before you run
If you don't already have it, you need to install `xcowsay`.

**Installing xcowsay on Debian based systems:**
```
sudo apt install xcowsay
```

**Installing xcowsay on Arch based systems:**
```
yay xcowsay
```
*Note: use whatever AUR helper you have, I just used `yay` as an example*

Then you have to clone the repository and start the script!
```
git clone https://github.com/Jonatan6/moo.sh
sh moo.sh/moo.sh
```
